This is the R script for a course final project.

The aim of the porject is to examine the causal relationship between number of books at home and math achievements from 4th grade to 8th grade.
In this project, missing score was treated using multiple imputation. Propensity score matching and weighting are used to balance treatment group and control group. According to the results, propensity score weighting can provide a better balance between the groups. Therefore, the average treatment effect was later calculated based on the results of propensity score weighting.

Statistical significance was found after the analysis.
